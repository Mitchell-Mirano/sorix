    "Sorix's **`autograd`** engine automatically computes the derivatives of functions defined using Tensors, enabling automatic differentiation. This capability eliminates the need for manual derivative implementation, allowing developers to focus on defining the computational logic.\n",

    "Every operation involving a **`tensor`** contributes to building a **Computational Graph**  that records the history of calculations. The crucial **`.backward()`** method then traverses this graph in reverse, applying the **chain rule** to determine the gradients of the output with respect to the input Tensors.\n",
